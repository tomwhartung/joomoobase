Joomoo Base supports multiple types of captchas so that if one becomes
compromised or obsolete for some reason adminstrators can quickly switch to
another.

 Overview
==========
The joomoobase component supports the following types of captchas:

o  OpenCaptcha: http://opencaptcha.com/
o  reCAPTCHA: http://recaptcha.net/
  -> requires you obtain Public and Private keys from their site
      see "Important Note About Setting up reCAPTCHA" below

The captcha_type parameter is set in the back end and determines which captcha
type the application uses.

 Are You Sure You Want to Use Captcha?
=======================================
An overview of Captcha is available at the wikipedia:

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha

Depending on the application, in many cases it is unnecessary to use captchas.

For example, if the user has javascript enabled, it is a good indication that
he or she is human and not a bot.  And regarding comment spam, if the ability
to leave a comment is restricted to users who are logged-in, it should
not be necessary to verify the user is human.

Having to repeatedly solve captchas can be annoying to users.  It is best to
set options in the back end so that this annoyance can be kept to a miniumum.

Be sure you consider the culture of your site, understand what the options
in the backend do with respect to captcha functionality, and set these
options accordingly.  Remember, if you start to see undesireable people
logging in and/or leaving comments, it's easy to quickly tighten up
security by changing these options.

 Pros and Cons of the Captcha Types
====================================
OpenCaptcha and reCAPTCHA each have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Advantages and Disadvantages of OpenCaptcha
-------------------------------------------
Advantages:
o  OpenCaptcha does not require creating an account on their site and
   obtaining public and private keys

Disadvantages:
o  OpenCaptcha provides no audio alternative for vision-impaired users
o  Php must be properly configured - see "Troubleshooting" below

Advantages and Disadvantages of reCAPTCHA
-----------------------------------------
Advantages:
o  reCAPTCHA supports an audio alternative for vision impaired users
o  reCAPTCHA helps the effort to digitize books

Disadvantages:
o  reCAPTCHA can cause issues on Internet Explorer - see the section on
   "Troubleshooting"

 Important Note About Setting up reCAPTCHA
===========================================
Before using reCAPTCHA you must obtain Public and Private keys from their site
and plug them into the joomoobase constants.php file, as decribed in the
following procedure:

1. Visit http://recaptcha.net/
2. Click on Get reCAPTCHA
3. Click on the Sign up Now! button at the bottom of the page
4. If you have an account, log into it, else create a new account
5. Fill out the form and click on Create Key
5. Copy and paste your keys into the file
      components/com_joomoobase/assets/constants.php
   Update the define statement for RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY with the value for
      the public key for your site(s) from recaptcha.net
   Update the define statement for RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY with the value for
      the private key for your site(s) from recaptcha.net

 Troubleshooting
=================
Following are solutions to some issues you may encounter using captcha with
joomoo components.

Possible Issues With OpenCaptcha:
---------------------------------
1. The allow_url_fopen option must be set to 'On' in php.ini 
Symptoms
If the Use Ajax? option in the back end is set to off, the application behaves
as if the input string is always wrong.
If the Use Ajax? option in the back end is set to on, the application displays
the following message:
   Warning: file_get_contents() [function.file-get-contents]: URL file-access
      is disabled in the server configuration

Solution
Fix this issue by:
1. setting the allow_url_fopen option to 'On' in php.ini
2. restarting the web server

Possible Issues With reCaptcha:
-------------------------------
reCAPTCHA works best on browsers other than Internet Explorer (IE) when
javascript is enabled.

1. Pages containing comments do not completely load in IE
Symptoms
When loading the page in IE 6, a popup appears stating "Operation Aborted."
When loading the page in IE 7 or 8, a popup appears stating:
   Message: HTML Parsing Error: Unable to modify the parent container element
      before the child element is closed (KB927917)

Solution
To fix the issue in IE8, it is possible to install a plugin that automatically 
switches the browser into compatibility mode.  Following is a link where you
can download this plugin:

   http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/style-a-design/browsers-a-web-standards/7623

Be sure to enable the new plugin ("System - IE8 Compatibility") under
Extensions -> Plugin Manager.  Experimentation shows that this may yield
mixed results, depending on your specific configuration.  It won't help
IE6&7 much and it seems like IE8 doesn't recognize it right away....

 Design/Technical Note:
========================
The JoomoobaseCaptcha class defined in com_joomoobase/captcha/JoomoobaseCaptcha.php
does not use inheritance, because the nature of these captchas differs
significantly.

o  The recaptcha site furnishes us with a library that we do not want to modify
   the components/com_joomoobase/captcha/recaptcha-php-1.0 contains the contents
   of the recaptcha-php-1.10.zip ownloaded from their site.
o  The opencaptcha site furnishes us with example code that we have changed so
   that it can be used in a similar fashion to that contained in
   recaptcha-php-1.0 .

The possibility that we may integrate another captcha type will be a good test to
see how well we have designed a uniform interface to captcha functionality....
