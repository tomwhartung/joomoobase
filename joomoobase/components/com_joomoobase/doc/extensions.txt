                         ===================                      March 31, 2010

 Introduction
==============
Joomoo extensions build on the functionality of the Joomla Content Management
System (CMS) and the Mootools Javascript library to provide webmasters with an
integrated set of extensions that implement basic Web 2.0 functionality.

This file contains preliminary documentation of the following extensions:

o  JoomooBase: contains code shared by all Joomoo extensions
o  JoomooComments: supports comments on content articles and gallery images
o  JoomooGallery: displays lists of galleries, pages of gallery groups, and
   individual gallery images
o  JoomooRating: allows rating of content articles, gallery groups and images
o  JoomooSitestyle: allows users to customize the appearance of the site

When time permits, plans call for the building of a website that uses these
extensions and makes them available for download free of charge.  Plans call
for that site to provide documentation that is more formal and complete.

 Configurability
-----------------
All Joomoo extensions are very flexible.  This document explains how site
administrators can customize these extensions in the Joomla CMS backend.

Each Joomoo extension also contains a constants.php file that allows site
administrators to easily fine-tune each extension.

 Compatibility
---------------
All Joomoo extensions require the server run PHP5.

Although these extensions make use of Javascript and the Mootools Javascript
library, they are designed and developed to degrade gracefully and provide
essential functionality for users who have Javascript disabled in their
browser.

These extensions were developed in a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP)
environment.  Due to financial and time constraints, these extensions have
not been tested running on a Microsoft server (IIS/Windows) or in an
Apple environment, but it is hoped that they should run fine in those
environments with little or no modification.

 JoomooBase
============
This extension contains two simple content plugins, but its main purpose
is to provide a library that contains code shared by one or more of the
other Joomoo extensions.

 Features
----------
Joomoobase contains PHP and Javascript code that:

o  Provides a PHP base class for interfacing with the Joomla database API
o  Supports the construction, sending, and processing of Ajax requests
o  Serves as a consistent interface for the handling of cookies
o  Provides a PHP class that interfaces with the Joomla JMail class
o  Allows the use of two types of CAPTCHA: OpenCaptcha and reCAPTCHA
   o  Each type has its advantages and disadvantages
   o  Site administrators can use the Joomla backend to easily switch
      between one and the other

 Plugins
---------
Joomoobase includes two very simple content plugins:

o  joomoosharethis: allows site administrators to put a placeholder in
   content articles that the plugin replaces with Javascript code for
   a "share this" button
   o  Site administrators can download the required Javascript from a
      site such as sharethis.com
   o  Administrators then use the Joomla backend to make this Javascript
      code available to the plugin
o  joomoodebug: displays parameters passed to Joomla content plugins,
   and is useful when designing and debugging these plugins

 JoomooShareThis Backend Parameter
-----------------------------------
sharethis_url
    URL (eg. from sharethis.com) that enables users to 'share-this' post
    Text field

 JoomooComments
================
This extension consists of a Joomla component and content plugin that
support user-generated comments on Joomla content articles and
JoomooGallery groups and images.

 Features
----------
The JoomooComments extension contains PHP and Javascript code that provides:

o  Links for users to "Like" or "Dislike" a comment and a display of
   the total "Likes" and "Dislikes" for each comment
o  Links for users to flag comments as spam and maintain a count of the total
   times users have flagged the comment
o  Links allowing users to delete their own comments and allowing advanced
   users to delete any user's comments - in the front end
o  Backend component functionality allowing site administrators to view, update,
   and delete comments
   o  Site administrators can view all comments in a list format
   o  List provides the ability to sort, filter, and edit comments
o  Backend plugin parameters that site administrators can use to control the
   appearance of the comments
   o  The first_last parameter specifies a maximum number to show
   o  The minimum_to_hide parameter specifies a minimum number to hide
o  Advanced backend plugin parameters that allow site administrators to specify
   restrictions on who can comment, supporting several ways to prevent
   and combat comment spam
   o  Site administrators can choose to allow or disallow anonymous comments
   o  Site administrators can choose to have the plugin send them an email
      when someone flags a comment as spam
   o  Plugin can optionally log IP addresses when anonymous users leave a comment
   o  Site administrators can specify whether to require users solve a
      CAPTCHA - ie. type one or two words that appear in an image - prove that
      they are human and not a spambot
   o  Plugin supports two types of CAPTCHA: OpenCaptcha and reCAPTCHA
   o  Site administrators can request or force anonymous users to enter an
      email address when they leave a comment
   o  Site administrators can request or force all users to enter a website
      when they leave a comment

The Like, Dislike, Flag as Spam, and Delete links use Ajax to communicate with
the server.  This means that these links:

o  Respond to the user's actions immediately and without a page refresh
o  Do not work when the user has Javascript disabled in their browser

 Database Columns
------------------
Following are the columns in the jos_joomoocomments table:

Field (note)     Type                   Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
id               int(11) unsigned       Standard joomla primary key
created_by       int(11) unsigned       Foreign key: jos_users table

contentid        int(11) unsigned       Foreign key: jos_content table
gallerygroupid   int(11) unsigned       Foreign key: jos_joomoogallerygroups table

spam             tinyint(3) unsigned    Times this comment has been flagged as spam
ordering         int(11) unsigned       Standard joomla ordering column

Notes:
(1) Backend parameters allow site administrators to request or require that
    registered and/or anonymous users specify a name when they post a comment,
    so this value does not necessarily match the name in the jos_users table
(2) Backend parameters allow site administrators to request or require that
    anonymous posters specify an email address and/or a website

 JoomooGallery
===============
This extension consists of a component that supports three types of views, i.e.,
menu options:

o  An option to display a list of gallery pages
o  An option to display a gallery page containing groups of images
o  An option to display a single image

Clicking on an image displayed on a gallery page causes the component to
display the single image on a page by itself.  Therefore site administrators
typically do not assign the option to display a single image to a menu item.

 Features
----------
The JoomooGallery extension contains PHP and Javascript code that provides a:

o  Backend component page to:
   o  List and add, change, and delete gallery groups
   o  List and add, change, and delete gallery images
   o  Site administrators can sort and filter both lists as is typical in
      the backend for other joomla components (e.g., content articles)
o  Backend component pages allowing site administrators to:
   o  Enable and disable joomoocomments for specific gallery groups and images
   o  Enable and disable joomooratings for specific gallery images

When creating a menu option for a gallery page in the backend, site
administrators can set options such as the following:

o  Image height, in pixels
o  Whether to display images in a single column or multiple columns
o  Whether to allow users to resize images with their mouse wheel
o  Whether to display image groups one at a time or all at once

See the section on Backend Parameters below for a description of each of the
options that site administrators can set in the backend for this extension.

 Database Tables and Columns
-----------------------------
This component uses two database tables, one for gallery groups and another
for gallery images.

Following are the columns in the jos_joomoogallerygroups table:

Field         Type                   Description

 JoomooRating
==============
This extension consists of a component and two plugins that allow users to
rate content articles and gallery images on a scale of one to ten.

The rating appears as a series of ten bars, similar to the bars on a cell
phone that show the strength of the signal.

 Features
----------
The JoomooRating extension contains PHP and Javascript code that:

o  Provides users the ability to rate an article or joomoogallery image.
o  Has backend functionality giving site administrators complete control over:
   o  Which articles and images can be rated
   o  How the rating bars appear: color, background, and hover bump
   o  What the rating rates: Agreeability, Likability, Believability, etc.
   o  Where the rating appears
   o  What the various levels mean
o  A fixed rating plugin, for cases when the rating is a "done deal"
   o  This is useful, for example, when the rating is irrelevant due to the
      nature of the article or image, or the type of rating
   o  Also useful in cases when the site administrator wants to close voting
      for some reason but wants to preserve the average rating

 JoomooSiteStyle
=================
This extension consists of a Joomla template, component, and module that allow
users to customize the appearance of the site.

This extension uses Ajax and relies heavily on Javascript and Mootools.  It
does not degrade as gracefully as the other Joomoo extensions do when the user
has Javascript disabled.  (The author is willing to improve this, for a fee.)

 Features
----------
The JoomooSiteStyle extension allows users to set the following style parameters:

o  Font size
o  Background color
o  Border color
o  Border style
o  Border width

This extension also allows site administrators to set the following values in
the backend:

o  Default values for the style parameters that users can set (listed above)
o  The following additional style and template parameters:
   o  Link color
   o  Heading color
   o  Bullet color
   o  Input Element color
o  The following template parameters:
   o  A tag line above the site name
   o  The site name
   o  A tag line below the site name

The backend for the template also allows site administrators to set a parameter
causing the component and module to save the values for anonymous users in the
database rather than as a cookie in their browser.  This option is useful for
sites that have a large number of anonymous users and only a few number of
registered users.

 Database Columns
------------------
Following are the columns in the jos_joomoocomments table:

Field               Type                   Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
id                  int(11) unsigned       Standard joomla primary key
user_id             int(11)                Foreign key: jos_users
ip_address          varchar(40)            IP address
background          varchar(20)            Background color
border_color_name   varchar(20)            Border color
border_style        varchar(20)            Border style
border_width        tinyint(1) unsigned    Border width in pixels
font_size           smallint(2) unsigned   Font size in pixels
timestamp           timestamp              Date and time stamp

Rather than rely on index tables for the background and border color and style,
which would be more efficient, this extension stores these parameters as
literal values.  This has the following advantages:

o  Makes it easier for non-technical people to add colors
o  Keeps the code simpler and easier to understand and debug
